This repository creates a dashboard for visualizing the data I have accumulated about my long history of 
Magic: The Gathering games. All the data is games played by me, with either physical paper cards or Magic's
current online plaftorm, Arena. I tried my best to document my games but this dataset is by no means
comprehensive.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Run the script in a Python environment:
   
   ```bash
   python visualizer.py
Then go to http://127.0.0.1:8050/ to view the data while the code is running!
